    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Nature Bytes is a web application that educates and informs users about environmental issues. It features four tabs - Home, Blogs, News, and Videos - that provide a unique and interactive experience. The Home tab provides an overview of the importance of environmental protection, the Blogs tab contains links to external websites with additional resources, the News tab displays the latest environmental news, and the Videos tab offers a custom video search functionality powered by the YouTube API.</p>
    <h2>How we built it?</h2>
    <p>Nature Bytes was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We utilized HTML for content structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions and data retrieval. We also leveraged APIs to retrieve real-time news and video data.</p>
